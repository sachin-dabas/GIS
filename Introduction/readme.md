Analyze housing unit rentals by county in the United States

[ The data for the project shows clearly that the highest housing unit rentals in the US are present in the major cities like California and Virginia. This demarcation is obvious since there are more people present in the cities than in the countryside or rural areas where the gross rent is very low for the housing units. 
There can be multiple extracts that can be extracted from this data. It is also possible to see that the housing units number is very high as compared to lowest gross unit regions which directly points to the increased population in the cities.
